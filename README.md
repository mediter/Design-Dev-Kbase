# Design-Dev-Knowledgebase
my personal collection of knowledge as I learn and build my skillsets

I want to try and build a fully functioning website to collect information I learned along the way. Starting with HTML, CSS, then expand it to include JavaScript, Python, Swift etc.

My initial general design consideration is a card-based layout, the initial view on each page show the referencable minimum of each key piece of information, with option to expand that to reveal further details in a card. Later on, try to add filtering functionality.
